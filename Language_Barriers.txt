What You Didn’t Know about Language Barriers | Roxanne Pomerantz

00:12 How many of you can speak more than one language?
00:16 Now, keep your hands up if you can speak more than two.
00:20 And how about three?
00:22 Very impressive!
00:25 (Applause)
00:28 But did you know that you actually could have easily learned 25 languages?
00:34 It's true.
00:35 This is a natural human phenomenon
00:38 that any normal child born anywhere in the world
00:42 is capable of learning any language that he or she is exposed to.
00:46 And did you know that the languages
00:48 that your child is exposed to before the age of 7,
00:51 which is also known as the critical age period,
00:54 are the only languages that he or she will be exposed to later in life?
00:59 Leonard Bloomfield said that "acquisition of a language
01:02 is doubtless the greatest intellectual feat
01:05 that anyone of us is ever required to perform."
01:10 So, I asked myself and some others in the overseas student program here:
01:14 why do we learn languages?
01:17 At first, we all learn language because we have to.
01:20 As humans, we're designed to learn language
01:23 just like we're designed to walk.
01:24 There is simply no preventing it.
01:26 But then, there are some of us who actually do it for fun.
01:29 We go through the struggle,
01:31 we put in the effort, feeling wrong all the time,
01:35 but we love it because the rewards are so great.
01:38 It's awesome to speak another language,
01:41 to carry it with you everywhere you go;
01:43 to travel and communicate with people in their native language
01:46 makes conversations so much more personal,
01:49 and you actually get to enjoy more out of life
01:52 because it gives you the opportunity to understand
01:55 more music, and movies, and games from around the world.
01:59 So I want to ask you another question,
02:02 and I want you all to think about this:
02:04 if we started taking advantage
02:06 of the amazing ability that children have to learn languages
02:09 and the plethora of free language learning tools
02:12 we have in our devices today,
02:14 could we, by reducing language barriers, reduce other barriers in society?
02:20 Which begs me to ask another question:
02:22 what exactly are language barriers
02:24 and what do they do?
02:26 I know what some of you are thinking:
02:28 you're at the dinner table,
02:30 and you're between your mother, who is Russian,
02:32 and your beautiful American girlfriend,
02:35 and you're having a moment of realization
02:38 that you've just hired yourself out as a translator.
02:42 So, you have to spend the whole evening
02:44 hearing everything 3 times,
02:46 and even though you thought that you could speak
02:49 English and Russian perfectly,
02:52 you're starting to feel confused and frustrated,
02:54 and you're desperate for a couple of minutes of alone time
02:57 just to think in whatever language you choose to think in.
03:01 But there is a lot more to language barriers that I want you to know.
03:05 Have you ever heard of linguistic relativity?
03:08 Linguistic relativity is the field
03:11 which asks questions on the relations
03:14 between language, perception, and thought.
03:18 The core theory is called the deterministic theory,
03:22 it is scientifically proven, and it states that the language you speak
03:26 shapes the way you think and influences your behavior.
03:31 The fathers of linguistic relativity, Benjamin Whorf and Edward Sapir,
03:35 state that if a word doesn't exist in your language,
03:38 you won't know the concept [behind the word].
03:40 Now, I think that those guys can be a little extreme in their theories.
03:45 I think rather that if a word doesn't exist in your language,
03:49 you are a lot less likely to identify with that concept.
03:54 One of my friends here, in Israel, a native German speaker,
03:57 told me a story once of how the English language
04:01 changed the way that she thought about love.
04:04 She told me she still remembers the first time she heard the term
04:08 "falling in love",
04:11 and that she was shocked at the use of the language
04:13 because she had never thought of being in love
04:15 as something that happened suddenly and dramatically,
04:19 and she pictured someone actually falling,
04:23 and she could feel that, and then she knew that someday
04:26 she will experience "falling" in love and not just "being" in love.
04:34 Also, in body language we find interesting differences among languages.
04:40 In Hebrew this means "waits".
04:44 However, this is a great insult in Italy,
04:50 and I wanted you all to know that.
04:52 (Laughter)
04:54 And the most obvious differences in languages
04:58 that are influencing our thoughts and behaviors is in vocabulary.
05:03 One scientific experiment in linguistic relativity
05:05 showed how gender association impacts people's perception.
05:09 This study used the word "key",
05:12 which is in German a masculine word,
05:17 and in Spanish it's feminine.
05:19 So, subjects were asked to come up with words to describe a key.
05:23 And the German speakers used words such as "heavy",
05:26 "durable", "strong", "useful", "metal",
05:31 but the Spanish speakers chose words such as "golden",
05:34 "lovely", "little", "delicate" and "shiny" to describe the same word -- "key".
05:43 Another interesting difference we find among languages
05:46 is in the perception of correctness.
05:49 I read in the study by John Myhill at University of Haifa
05:53 that correctness in present day English and most European languages
05:59 is based on prestige.
06:02 So, the development of these languages
06:04 has actually followed the trends of its most elite speakers.
06:09 But other languages perceive correctness in a much different way.
06:14 Languages such as Arabic, and Hebrew, and Icelandic
06:17 are based on textual references.
06:20 So, if a word appears in a text-- in Arabic, which is based on the Koran,
06:26 and Hebrew is based on The Mishneh Torah
06:28 if a word or grammar appears in this text, it is correct,
06:31 and if it doesn't, it is not correct.
06:33 For these languages there is no connection
06:35 between correctness and prestige.
06:38 And there are many, many words in languages
06:40 that don't appear anywhere else such as "stam" [סטם] in Hebrew,
06:44 which can be translated into English as "just kidding", but not really --
06:49 it is a unique word to let someone know you're not being serious.
06:54 And "khalomot paz" [חלומות פז] is how you say "sweet dreams" in Hebrew,
06:58 but actually translates directly as "golden dreams".
07:02 And there is a word in German that I love called "Fernweh",
07:06 which dictionaries translate as "itchy feet",
07:10 and it is the opposite of "homesick".
07:13 It describes the feeling that you need to travel.
07:15 So, when my German friend taught me this word, I thought:
07:18 "Wow! How I wish that this word existed in my language!"
07:23 And I wondered that if we used such a word,
07:25 how my experience of feeling like the only one in my family
07:29 with a strong desire to see the world may have been different.
07:32 So, a few weeks ago, after I auditioned to be up here on the TEDx stage,
07:37 I reached out to my psychology professor back in New York
07:40 and asked him what he thought about linguistic relativity.
07:43 And what he says explains the story of my friend
07:47 and, in terms of psychology and memory,
07:51 what happened when she learned a new term about love.
07:55 He said: "It is the breadth of our language, not our vast experiences,
08:01 which help color our lives.
08:03 That is, in memory,
08:06 the language labels that we assign events and experiences shape, indeed;
08:11 limit the way that we can remember them."
08:14 For example, if the only positive emotion word we knew was "happy",
08:20 all positive memories are labeled as "happy memories".
08:25 And if they all fit in that "happy" bucket together,
08:29 then their shared features, which make them labeled as "happy",
08:33 will be reinforced and at times amplified at the expense of their differences
08:37 to allow for better access.
08:40 This is because your mind categorizes everything with language labels,
08:43 so that it can reach for your memories as quickly as possible.
08:47 And everything that you say and do,
08:50 every decision you make, every conversation that you have,
08:53 is just a consequence of some memories, right?
08:57 So, in other words, your ability, overall, to access your memories
09:03 is actually directly related
09:05 to your breadth and knowledge of vocabulary.
09:09 Because our languages are constantly changing,
09:12 language barriers are just growing bigger and bigger.
09:15 So, what do you think everyone?
09:18 If we started to take advantage
09:22 of children's amazing ability to learn languages
09:25 and the plethora of free tools that we have to learn languages today,
09:30 could we, by reducing language barriers, reduce other barriers in society?
09:36 The answer to me is crystal clear.
09:39 By emphasizing foreign language studying in your community,
09:42 you are seizing an opportunity to reverse the creation of gaps
09:46 in the way that we think and behave.
09:49 There are so many issues in society today
09:51 that are thought-based, like racism, and hate crimes, and bullying.
09:57 So, by increasing the knowledge of language,
10:00 we can overcome these differences;
10:02 also, by having more multilingual programs for children, of course,
10:07 because it's that critical age period before age 7,
10:10 where we have this opportunity.
10:13 So, one such program exists in Jaffa called the Orchard of Abraham's Children.
10:17 It was founded by a Palestinian man an a Jewish woman, who are married.
10:22 And they've established 3 kindergartens that teach in both Arabic and Hebrew,
10:27 and celebrate both cultures' holidays.
10:30 So, programs, like this one, are using bilingual education
10:34 to promote peace and co-existence in a humanitarian, non-political way.
10:39 And it is so effective,
10:41 because our languages are a huge part of our identity.
10:44 Being born to reformed Jewish parents,
10:47 gave me really early exposure to the Hebrew language,
10:50 and if it wasn't for that early, early exposure,
10:52 I am sure I wouldn't be here, in Israel, studying linguistics,
10:55 or giving this talk to you about the power
10:58 of being able to identify with more than one language.
11:02 Now, I want to leave you with this quote by Helen Keller,
11:06 who was an American author, a political activist,
11:10 and the first deaf-blind person ever to receive the Bachelor of Arts degree:
11:16 "Suddenly I felt a misty consciousness
11:19 as of something forgotten --
11:22 a thrill of returning thought;
11:26 and somehow, the mystery of language was revealed to me.
11:31 Everything had a name,
11:33 and each name gave birth to a new thought."
11:37 Thank you.
11:38 (Applause)
