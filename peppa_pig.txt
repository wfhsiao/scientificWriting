Peppa is blowing bubbles in her drink.
You really shouldn't play with your drink.
Peppa, if you like bubbles, why don't you play with your bubble mixture?
First, dip the stick in the mixture. Then, take a big breath and blow.
Dip the stick in the mixture, hold it up, take a big breath... and blow!
George is trying really hard, but he is running out of breath.
I know a way George can make bubbles. Dip the stick in the mixture, then lift it up, and wave it around.
It's even better if you run along.
George is having fun making bubbles, and Peppa is having fun popping them.
Oh dear. The bubble mixture is all used up.
