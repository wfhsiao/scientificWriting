12. Opening a presentation
Anna
Today I'm going to... Today I'm going to present our revolutionary, new Imperial Lemon. I'll start by telling you a bit about Tip Top Trading and some of the exciting new developments at our company. And then…I’m going to move on to explain how the Imperial Lemon is designed and what makes it so revolutionary. And finally, you will all have a chance to see it close up for yourselves and ask questions. So, let's begin. This picture shows...

13. Making a pitch
Anna
Tip Top Trading is growing fast – our number of clients doubled last year. This is because our company has a strong track record of reliability and because, thanks to new technology, our fruits are more and more convincing. Our bananas have won awards for being the most authentic-looking fruits in Europe. We are very happy that Citrus Ventures is already among our clients and we hope to build on that by offering you more exciting new fruits. Let me share with you our latest product: the Imperial Lemon.
The Imperial Lemon's key strengths are its design and flexibility. It is made with revolutionary faux-orange-premium, laser-curve-definition technology... 

16. Politely refusing something
Anna
Well, thank you for your offer. But I'm really sorry, I won't be able to.

Mr Lime
Oh?

Anna
I'm afraid it's against company policy to have non-business lunches with people.

Mr Lime
Really? Oh how tedious!

Anna
You see, it wouldn't be appropriate. So, with regret, I'm going to have to say no.

Anna
Goodbye.


17. Placing an order
Right... Hello, sorry about that... I'd like to place an order for some imperial lemon-sized luxury boxes, please... we're going to need quite a few... could you send 300 please... yes... the green ones... could we also have the name of our company on the sides... when can we expect to receive them...okay, thank you, goodbye. There! How was that?

18. Writing an email
Tom
Hang on, Anna, let me just finish this sentence. It’s really important. I’m ready, let’s have a look. Okay. (reading) Dear Mr Lime, I hope you are well. I am writing regarding your request for luxury boxes for the Imperial Lemon Delivery. We will indeed be able to supply them. Please could you confirm that you want 300. Best wishes, Anna.

Anna
Well?

Tom
It’s good, it's much better. Send it. Hopefully Mr Lime will think your last message was just someone sitting on your keyboard by mistake.

Anna
Thanks.
